## mini-feature "Xeditable but with Tinymce" for other app, Anglify Bootstrap

As a logged-in User
I want to *select an element with text and bring up a TinyMCE text-editor
so that I may change the content to my leisure.

1. set a listener to click on any DOM element.
2. save the inner content of the DOM element.
3. remove the DOM element and replace it with a TinyMCE directive that has said content.
4. once submit is done, take the content and return it as a new div element.
